Simple Scoreboards is a web application that provides a ‘score bug’ overlay for live streamers. It can be used to design and control a custom, digital scoreboard. By default, it supports a small suite of sports.

## Setup Guide

Simple Scoreboards is designed as a supplemental tool for streaming software. The application can be tested and used without one, but the intent is to use it with one. We recommend OBS as the streaming software, as it is popular, well-maintained, and free. https://obsproject.com/download

The application itself can be accessed from www.simplescoreboards.com. Precise instructions for how to set up the application locally are present in the programmer documentation in our project submission.

## User Instructions

Precise instructions for how to use the software are present in the user documentation in our project submission.

## Source

A brief description of all files and directories in the project repository can be found in the programmer documentation in our project submission.

## Access Keys

For setting up a local build, you will need AWS access keys for amplify integration. They can be found in the README in our project submission.

# Simple Scoreboards
simple scoreboards aims to provide an overlay tool to producers of sports broadcasting productions. Our product aims to be budget friendly and simple to use, Ideal for amatuer broadcasters or for use in educational context. 
## how it works
Our product provides an HTML page which contains a scoreboard and a transparent background. Users can then take this page and add it to broadcasting apps, like Open Broadcasting Software (OBS), to give their own broadcast an overlay similar to what you may find on telecast of professional sporting events. Our product also will provide an controller page so that the broadcaster can operate the scoreboard during the game. This tool is an visual aid that sports broadcasters will add to their broadcast in order to give viewers visual representation of the state of the game their broadcasting. 


## aspirations
we hope to make scoreboard presets for multiple sports. Additionally, we wish to allow users to be able to create and save presets for reuse (hence why we implemented auth). These are our must have goals.
In terms of could have goals, we have breifly looked into allowing users to broadcast directly from our site to youtube using the youtube api though this is still something we are exploring conceptually to see if its possible.
